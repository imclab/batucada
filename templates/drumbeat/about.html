    <em>Drumbeat is a global community of innovators like you, building a more

    <em>Mozilla is all about shaping the future of the web for the public
    good.</em> With Drumbeat, we’re moving beyond Firefox to build more things
    that make the web better, not just software.  We&apos;re doing that by
    reaching out to new kinds of people &ndash; educators, filmmakers,
    journalists, scientists, artists &ndash; to work together on open projects
    and design challenges that build a better web and world. We did that with
    Firefox. Now we want to do it on a broader scale, with new projects and
    people like you.

    <em>Through open web tools and thinking.</em> Applied to your personal passion or project. Mozilla believes the internet is a shared public resource and force for good. If we care about the web&apos;s future, we need a diverse range of people involved in shaping the web in their world &ndash; especially those trying to disrupt and innovate. </p>
<p>
Drumbeat provides open web tools and thinking to help do this. And connects 
innovators in areas like education, media and science with smart hackers and  technologists. The result? Drumbeat helps you build new projects the same way Mozilla built Firefox &ndash; by working in the open, collaborating through open web tools, and enabling participation from contributors around the world.
